Game Idea #1 : Everything Costs Energy

2d top down shooter 

No Hp bar, no ammo bar, only an "energy" bar

Every action costs energy

Existing, moving, shooting, taking damage, and any other actions will deplete the energy bar

The player will start each level with a full bar, and will need to make it to the end of a level before it reaches zero

Each level will contain the player, enemies, and a level exit

A level exit will complete the current level and begin the next level

For each level completed, the players starting energy will shrink, making each additional level harder than the last.
For example, if a player starts a level with 100 energy and then completes the level, 
they may start with 90 energy on the next level

Each level will be generated by randomly selecting one of a few different setpeices

A setpeice will contain walls, doors or any other physical obstacals

Each setpeice will have multiple possible spawn locations for each game element 
For example, if we want a level to contain 3 enemies, these may be spawned in 3 of maybe 6 possible spawn locations

Other things we could add if we have time:
	A coin pickup. This would cost energy to pick up, but maybe it could increase starting energy on the next level if
	you bring it to the end of the current level. Maybe we could even make it a physical object that you need to
	physically move to the level exit by shooting it
	
	Different shooting patterns. If aiming was done with the mouse we could have left click fire a shotgun-like 
	high-damage spread of multiple short-range bullets with lots of recoil, and right click could fire a single
	long-range low-damage shot with little recoil.
